# WebRTC

First peer creates and offer to another peer to connect. This SDP Session  Description Protocol

Created object contains information describing the peer to peer connection like video codec etc.

There is a server called signaling server. Another peer can read the data on that server. This data is used to answer the call. Second peer also creates an sdp object and writes that to the server. This process is called signaling and handled by a third part server. 

ICE protocol used to get rid of NAT problems and firewalls. There are ICE candidates. It helps clients coordinate the discover of their public facing IP and port. Both peers generate list of ICE candidates contains IP and port addresses. 

Each peer saves their ICE candidates in the db so that other peer can read them. Algo detects which peer is the best. Real time media can begin flowing between the two peers

## What is SIP?

Session Initiation Protocol. 

IP communication session, use IP devices and IP network to communicate. All communications starts with a signaling. 

1-Invitation signal

2-OK response signal

3-Dialog begins

When conversation is about to end there is another signaling

1-Ending now signal

2-OK response signal

3-Conversation is over

There are two type of packets in SIP communication. 

1-Signaling Packets

2-Media Packets

In one side of the VoIP, audio is encoded into packets and sent through IP network.

At the other side, this packets are decoded and wave reconstructed and plays back.

Same thing is done on the images-video communication.

There are two rules to ensure this communication is working properly:

1-Both parties know each others location-address

2-Both parties use the same codecs

How to know other sides IP address

How to decide which codec to use

There are descriptions and rules that help us locate each other.

This is protocol

Session Initiation Protocol. It defines

1-How to locate addresses

2-Which codec to use. 

3-How to construct & send IP signaling packets

4-How to act, manage connection

12 needs

1-User needs to communicate over an IP network

User Agents has 2 main tasks

1-It manages signaling

2-Capture, encode, send, decode and represent media

2-User Agents discover each others IP addresses

Registrar, Location services, SIP registry and Proxy server

First peer sends address of record (sip:user@ip.com) and Contact address (sip:192.168.1.100:5060) to the registrar service

Registar writes down to the database this information to the database.

Other peer sends invitation packet to the location service which contains address of record. It queries with that and finds an ip address and sends the invite packet to the receiver client. Sender client does not known other sides IP address but location server does. When invite packet is received, there is a packet sent to the first inviter. This packet includes invited clients address. Now both sides known each others IP address and can begin to exchange media.

Proxy  = Location and Registrar

3-Features that enhance the communcations experience.

For example call forwarding

Other logics are seperate, proxt has just routing logic. Seperating them gives flexibilty and upgrading them is easy.

4-Play, record media and collect DTMF input

There is a server called SIP Media Server

It has endpoint user agent, records inbound media, plays back recorded media and captures DTMF tones

It has also media bridge used in conferencing to provide all parties can hear each other.

SIP Media server is also seperated from proxy server.

5-Calls between users on different domains

If second user is in the different domain, proxy servers looks to the DNS servers and domain names.

6-Provide forwarding information

Redirect service, passes the forwarding address upstream. Old domain tells that they moved, but I’ll tell you where.

7-Protect the network

The Session Border Controller - SBC

Controls incoming and outgoing traffic. Changes internal addresses to external addresses. There is a mapping. 

8-Communicate with non-SIP users

Gateway devices.

1-Signaling gateway : Signaling protocol translator

Gateway receives signal and turns that packet into SS7 IAM message.

2-Media Gateway : Different users has different encoding algorithms, so Media gateway transcodes media from one form to the other.
