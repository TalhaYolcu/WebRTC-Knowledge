# WebRTC

First peer creates and offer to another peer to connect. This SDP Session  Description Protocol

Created object contains information describing the peer to peer connection like video codec etc.

There is a server called signaling server. Another peer can read the data on that server. This data is used to answer the call. Second peer also creates an sdp object and writes that to the server. This process is called signaling and handled by a third part server. 

ICE protocol used to get rid of NAT problems and firewalls. There are ICE candidates. It helps clients coordinate the discover of their public facing IP and port. Both peers generate list of ICE candidates contains IP and port addresses. 

Each peer saves their ICE candidates in the db so that other peer can read them. Algo detects which peer is the best. Real time media can begin flowing between the two peers

## What is SIP?

Session Initiation Protocol. 

IP communication session, use IP devices and IP network to communicate. All communications starts with a signaling. 

1-Invitation signal

2-OK response signal

3-Dialog begins

When conversation is about to end there is another signaling

1-Ending now signal

2-OK response signal

3-Conversation is over

There are two type of packets in SIP communication. 

1-Signaling Packets

2-Media Packets

In one side of the VoIP, audio is encoded into packets and sent through IP network.

At the other side, this packets are decoded and wave reconstructed and plays back.

Same thing is done on the images-video communication.

There are two rules to ensure this communication is working properly:

1-Both parties know each others location-address

2-Both parties use the same codecs

How to know other sides IP address

How to decide which codec to use

There are descriptions and rules that help us locate each other.

This is protocol

Session Initiation Protocol. It defines

1-How to locate addresses

2-Which codec to use. 

3-How to construct & send IP signaling packets

4-How to act, manage connection

12 needs

1-User needs to communicate over an IP network

User Agents has 2 main tasks

1-It manages signaling

2-Capture, encode, send, decode and represent media

2-User Agents discover each others IP addresses

Registrar, Location services, SIP registry and Proxy server

First peer sends address of record (sip:user@ip.com) and Contact address (sip:192.168.1.100:5060) to the registrar service

Registar writes down to the database this information to the database.

Other peer sends invitation packet to the location service which contains address of record. It queries with that and finds an ip address and sends the invite packet to the receiver client. Sender client does not known other sides IP address but location server does. When invite packet is received, there is a packet sent to the first inviter. This packet includes invited clients address. Now both sides known each others IP address and can begin to exchange media.

Proxy  = Location and Registrar

3-Features that enhance the communcations experience.

For example call forwarding

Other logics are seperate, proxt has just routing logic. Seperating them gives flexibilty and upgrading them is easy.

4-Play, record media and collect DTMF input

There is a server called SIP Media Server

It has endpoint user agent, records inbound media, plays back recorded media and captures DTMF tones

It has also media bridge used in conferencing to provide all parties can hear each other.

SIP Media server is also seperated from proxy server.

5-Calls between users on different domains

![Untitled](WebRTC%2047bafe9b471e45148e89962d15587efd/Untitled.png)

If second user is in the different domain, proxy servers looks to the DNS servers and domain names.

6-Provide forwarding information

Redirect service, passes the forwarding address upstream. Old domain tells that they moved, but I’ll tell you where.

7-Protect the network

The Session Border Controller - SBC

Controls incoming and outgoing traffic. Changes internal addresses to external addresses. There is a mapping. 

8-Communicate with non-SIP users

Gateway devices.

1-Signaling gateway : Signaling protocol translator

Gateway receives signal and turns that packet into SS7 IAM message.

2-Media Gateway : Different users has different encoding algorithms, so Media gateway transcodes media from one form to the other.

Note :

TCP → web

UDP → real time communications

## Main components of WebRTC

- GetUserMedia() → get camera and microphone
- RTCPeerConnection() → help to setup video and audio calls between peers. Takes care of encode, decode, NAT traversal
- RTCDataChannel() help to share data over peer connection
- GetStats() help to get webrtc session

### Why it is popular?

Open source and free

performance is better

### Websocket vs Http

Websocket is a bidirectional mechanism for browser communication. There are two types to communicate in browsers. One is http and other is websocket

http is used to get resources like image webpages etc…

In http, browser is client and web server is a server. Http uses client server protocol

In websocket, browser connects to the web server by establishing a socket connection. In websocket browser also can respond.

In http browser only sends requests, web server always send responses

WE can establish a websocket by using : ws://

websocket has also client server protocol.

Websocket is a statfeul protocol means that connection between client and server will keep alive unit it is terminated by one of them

![Untitled](WebRTC%2047bafe9b471e45148e89962d15587efd/Untitled%207.png)

We will use webRTC because it has high-performance, high quality communication of video, audio and data

WebRTC is faster and it has browser to browser communication

Websocket uses TCP , webRTC uses UDP

websocket has latency

Actually, webrtc uses websockets

In signaling mechanism, webrtc uses websockets.

## What is signaling?

- Process of setting up, controlling and terminating a comm. session between clients
- Three processes included
    - Session control info
    - Exchange IP addresses and ports
    - Exchange codecs and media types of the user
    

### Session control info

It will determine when needs to be connected, closed and send info between users

### IP and port related info

Identify the where users located

### Codec and media type

Setup particular resolution and media configuration

All sum up in SDP → Session Description Protocol

There should be a server to exchange user data initally setup to WebRTC connection

After signaling, all media and data will be exchanged via RTCPeerConnection of WebRTC

RTCPeerConnection() creates connection between peers

Signaling Process

![Untitled](WebRTC%2047bafe9b471e45148e89962d15587efd/Untitled%208.png)

After signaling, peer can communicate with each other without using a server. This can be done by ICE frameworks. Devices may not know each others public IP addresses

ICE communicates two nodes directly, but sometimes NATs and firewalls makes it difficult. So we have STUN and TURN protocols to solve this.

ICE uses STUN and TURN 

### STUN and TURN?

User can request its public IP address from STUN server. Now, this public IP is reachable by other user.

If user is under symmetric NAT, that will not work.

TURN server is used to when users under symmetric NAT

Disadvantage of that : STUN is not required after signaling, TURN is required for whole session

most of ICE framework uses STUN as default.

in short i STUN and TURN is used to get users public IP adress, STUN is commonly used

There are free STUN servers but TURN servers always require a password for protection. It requires more traffic

WebRTC knows how to talk to another peer, but does not how to discover., So we have to do signaling

If we send this SDP offers and answers to each other, we don’t have another server for signaling.

SDP messages consist of audio, video and codec parameters

webrtc is not limited by media streaming, we can do file sharing with that.

in webrtc , there are two techs to be used:

1. Media capture devices
2. Peer to peer connectivity

### RTCPeerConnection()

provides methods connecto to a remote peer

core part

![Untitled](WebRTC%2047bafe9b471e45148e89962d15587efd/Untitled%2013.png)

- Keeps track of local and remote streams
- Manages the ICE workflow for NAT Traversal
- API to generate connection offer, accent and answer

![Untitled](WebRTC%2047bafe9b471e45148e89962d15587efd/Untitled%2014.png)

### Peer to peer connection problems

- Peer may be offline, unreachable, busy, not interested
- Peer is connected to different signaling server
- Should listen for other peer connections

your sdp → local description

if you receive a offer → remote description
